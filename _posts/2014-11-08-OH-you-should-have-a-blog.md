Or maybe I read it somewhere. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus, whatever, all of these are just temporary, they come and go. At this point I’m wondering how a blog would be more permanent, anyway. 

I used to have one, it was more work related. Stuff mainly about storage and virtualization. 

What I’m going to post here? Tech Stuff. Anything technical I find cool. Sometimes work related sometimes not. I’m trying to use this thing as a future reference for myself. I found a script the other day I wrote 10+ years ago to load a phone log into a database. It was quite cool, but I did not remember it at all. I forgot stuff quicker than I should. 

Why sushi and burger? Because I love them. I travel a lot, if I eat alone mainly I end up with either sushi or burger. 

PS.: If you happen to be in the situation where I’ve been for a long time, so you have no idea what OH means: it’s ‘overheard’.
